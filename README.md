# Adafruit IO starter

The quick start directions to subscribe and publish MQTT to Adafruit IO have changed considerably over the last couple of years,
and I found most guides were not up to date. [This](https://learn.adafruit.com/mqtt-in-circuitpython/circuitpython-wifi-usage)
is the best I could find, and even that did not work out of the box.

This repo provides an example of the most current way I know of to spin up wifi/MQTT on Circuitpython 8 and publish a simple data
feed.

See the example_settings.toml for the four secrets you'll need to add to your settings.toml

## Setting up Adafruit IO

Most directions you'll find remain more or less correct, though the UI has changed considerably from present guides.
